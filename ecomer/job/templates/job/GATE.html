    <h1 id="top">GATE: Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>About GATE</h2>
            <p>
                Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering or GATE is an online national level examination conducted for Master of Engineering (ME), 
                Masters in Technology (MTech) and direct PhD admissions to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of 
                Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) and other institutes/universities across India. 
                The exam is jointly conducted by IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras, IIT Roorkee and 
                Indian Institute for Science, Bangalore (IISC Bangalore), on a rotational basis on behalf of the National Coordination Board 
                (NCB - GATE), Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource & Development (MHRD), Government of India.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to 
                various post-graduate education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Master of Architecture, Doctor of 
                Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. 
                Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings for recruiting graduate engineers in 
                entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India. GATE is also recognized by various institutes 
                outside India, such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

    <h2 id="preparationtips">Preparation Tips</h2>
    <h4>1. Understand the GATE syllabus and pattern</h4>
    <p>This is necessary as the syllabus may differ a little each year and there might be minute changes in the pattern as well. 
        Moreover, a thorough study plan cannot be created until the exam syllabus and pattern are known.</p>
    <h4>2. Find the books required according to the syllabus</h4>
    <p>Generally, two or three books are enough for a particular subject where one book can be used in the start and other books can be 
        referred if any doubts arise</p>
    <h4>3. Create a study plan for GATE preparation</h4>
    <p>It is necessary to have a study plan for GATE preparation as it inculcates discipline and time management skills.</p>
    <h4>4. Focus on Aptitude and Mathematics as well</h4>
    <p>It is very important to focus on Aptitude and Mathematics as they are quite scoring subjects and constitute around 30 marks in 
        the GATE exam.</p>
    <h4>5.	Prepare notes on the relevant topics</h4>
    <p>Preparing notes with the important information and formulae is vital as these notes can be referred later during revision. </p>
    <h4>6.	Strengthen your conceptual knowledge </h4>
    <p>It is important to have conceptual clarity as GATE is an exam that tests the candidates’ concepts and has very little questions 
        that have direct application of formulae.</p>
    <h4>7.	Familiarize yourself with the virtual calculator </h4>
    <p>This can result in an increase in calculation speed which is very advantageous in a competitive exam like GATE.</p>
    <h4>8.	Evaluate your understanding of a topic after studying it </h4>
    <p>This will reveal the weak points in your preparation that can then be eliminated. Moreover, self-evaluation also helps in 
        retaining the knowledge that you have learnt.</p>
    <h4>9.	Revise the topics at suitable intervals </h4>
    <p>After understanding a topic thoroughly, it is important to revise it at suitable intervals otherwise there is a chance of 
        forgetting it. </p>
    <h4>10.	Analyze previous GATE papers and attempt multiple mock tests </h4>
    <p>Analyzing and attempting previous GATE papers and GATE mock tests is an excellent way of understanding the GATE structure in a 
        controlled environment. This also helps in improving time management skills and reduces silly mistakes in the actual GATE exam.</p>
