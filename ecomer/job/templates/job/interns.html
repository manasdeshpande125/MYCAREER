<h1>How to get internship? </h1>
<h2>Consider Your Qualifications</h2>
<p>One of the most common misconceptions that students have about how to get an internship is that they must apply to every position that catches their eye to increase their odds. But this is a sure-fire recipe for radio silence from recruiters and hiring managers. Instead, think about the skills and experience you currently possess, and which positions you might be a good fit for based on that information. A few ways to narrow down which internships are right for you:</p>
<p>Think about your degree: Look up common career fields and job titles for people with your major.</p>
<p>Consider your experience: Think about your previous work experience, and which roles it might prepare you for. A student working at a campus newspaper might consider a journalism internship, while a student who tutors for a statistics class may want to look at data science internships.</p>
<p>Identify transferable skills: Skills that help you succeed in school or in the student organizations you participate in  such as organization, critical thinking and time management  will all be useful in the working world. Some quick research should reveal which jobs require these skills.</p>
<p>Explore your interests: With how much time you spend at work, you want to make sure you enjoy it! Write down a few career fields that interest you, and search internships in those areas.</p>
<p>Start small: Don't feel pressured to get your dream internship right away, especially if you have no prior work experience. Start by exploring small local organizations, groups affiliated with your school or volunteer work in order to bolster your resume.</p>

<h2>Use Your Colleges Career Resources:</h2><p> Almost all colleges have a career site where employers interested in hiring their students can post positions. Career and internship fairs can also be invaluable, as they allow you to connect face-to-face with hiring decision-makers.</p>

<h2>Leverage Your Network:</h2>
<p>Getting a personal recommendation can make all the difference in your internship search, so make sure to reach out to friends, family, colleagues, classmates, professors and alumni to see if they know anyone hiring. Another great strategy is to look up the companies you are interested in and reach out to employees there for an informational interview. You never know what opportunities it might lead to!</p>
