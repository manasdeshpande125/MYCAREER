<h2 id="exampatter">Exam Pattern</h2>
<p>GRE Exam Pattern for both versions is different. GRE Exam pattern for computer-based GRE is adaptive in nature. GRE General Test format has 3 different sections and the analytical skills are measured through this test. The main sections are GRE analytical writing assessment, GRE verbal reasoning, and GRE quantitative reasoning. All these sections have 2 subsections. The total time duration for GRE General Test is 3 hours 45 minutes. Three main sections of the GRE general test are as follows 
GRE Analytical Writing  
GRE Analytical Writing comprises two types of questions. Analyze and Issue and Analyze an Argument are two types of tasks asked in this section. Candidates get 60 minutes to attempt two sections of GRE analytical writing. 
GRE Verbal Reasoning
Candidates find GRE verbal reasoning section difficult for its tricky question types. Reading Comprehension, Text Completion, and Sentence Equivalence are three types of questions asked in this section. Candidates have to attempt 40 questions in 60 minutes. 
GRE Quantitative Reasoning
 With little practice, GRE quantitative reasoning can actually change the scorecard of the candidates. Quantitative comparison, Problem-solving, and Date interpretation comprise GRE quant syllabus. Candidates have to attempt 40 questions in 70 minutes. 
The GRE verbal section is comparatively easier than what the Power Prep series comprises, and candidates can actually score higher than what they generally obtain during the PowerPrep practice tests. Whereas, the GRE quant section’s first part is harder than what PowerPrep’s first part offers. Also, the last part of PowerPrep’s quant section is harder than what the actual test offers. From actual test-takers, it has been concluded that the GRE quant section, though might appear easy but is actually tricky. In fact, the experimental quant section is even harder.
