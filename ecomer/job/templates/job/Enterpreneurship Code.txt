                    viewed as change, generally entailing risk beyond what is normally encountered in starting a
                    business,which
                    may include other values than simply economic ones.</p>

                    <p>The entrepreneur is defined as someone who has the ability and desire to establish, administer
                        and succeed in a start-up venture along with risk entitled to it, to make profits. The best
                        example of entrepreneurship is the starting of a new business venture. The entrepreneurs are
                        often known as a source of new ideas or innovators and bring new ideas in the market by
                        replacing old with an invention.

                            entrepreneur.</li>
                        <li>An entrepreneur creates a firm to realize their idea, known as entrepreneurship, which
                            aggregates capital and labour to produce goods or services for profit.</li>
                        <li> Entrepreneurship is highly risky but also can be highly rewarding, as it serves to generate

                        considerable amount of failure risk. Therefore, an entrepreneur needs to be courageous and able
                        to evaluate and take risks, which is an essential part of being an entrepreneur.</li>
                    <li><span class="h-secondary">Innovation-</span> It should be highly innovative to generate new
                        ideas, start a company and earn profits out of it. Change can be the launching of a new product
                        that is new to the market or a process that does the same thing but in a more efficient and
                        economical way.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="h-secondary">Flexible-</span> An entrepreneur should be flexible and open to change
                        according to the situation. To be on the top, a businessperson should be equipped to embrace
                        change in a product and service, as and when needed.</li>
                    <li><span class="h-secondary">Visionary and Leadership quality-</span> To be successful, the
                        entrepreneur should have a clear vision of his new venture. However, to turn the idea into
                        reality, a lot of resources and employees are required. Here, leadership quality is paramount
                        because leaders impart and guide their employees towards the right path of success.</li>
                    <li><span class="h-secondary">Know your Product-</span>A company owner should know the product
                        offerings and also be aware of the latest trend in the market. It is essential to know if the
                        available product or service meets the demands of the current market, or whether it is time to
                        tweak it a little. Being able to be accountable and then alter as needed is a vital part of
                        entrepreneurship</li>

                        The Prime Minister of India launched the Startup India Initiative in the year 2016. The idea is
                        to increase wealth and employability by giving wings to entrepreneurial spirits. The government
                        gives tax benefits to startups under this scheme and 798 applicants have made use of this scheme
                        to date. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion is maintaining this initiative and is
                        treating it as a long term project. Moreover, the overall age limit for startups has been
                        increased from two years to seven years.

                        The government has made continuous efforts to improve the social and economic aspects of life in
                        rural areas of India. Since 56% of the Indian population lives in the rural areas, the
                        government is promoting entrepreneurship and innovation in the rural sector. The ASPIRE scheme
                        aims at increasing employment, reducing poverty, and encouraging innovation in rural India.
                        However, the main idea is to promote the agro-business industry. The Ministry of Medium and
                        Small Enterprises has tried to boost economic development at the grassroots level. The total
                        budget of the scheme was INR 62.5 crores for the period of 2014-2016.

                        The task of promoting entrepreneurship was earlier given to different departments and government
                        agencies. In 2014, the Prime Minister decided to dedicate an entire ministry to build this
                        sector as he felt that skill development required greater push from the government's side.
                        Furthermore, the idea is to reach 500 million people by the year 2022 through gap-funding and
                        skill development initiatives.
